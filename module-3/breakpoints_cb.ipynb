    "For `human-in-the-loop`, we often want to see our graph outputs as its running. \n",
    "\n",
    "We laid the foundations for this with streaming. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's talk about the motivations for `human-in-the-loop`:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) `Approval` - We can interrupt our agent, surface state to a user, and allow the user to accept an action\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) `Debugging` - We can rewind the graph to reproduce or avoid issues\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) `Editing` - You can modify the state \n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph offers several ways to get or update agent state to support various `human-in-the-loop` workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll introduce [breakpoints](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/human_in_the_loop/breakpoints/#simple-usage), which provide a simple way to stop the graph at specific steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll show how this enables user `approval`."
