    "## Review\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduced the [LangGraph Memory Store](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/store/#langgraph.store.base.BaseStore) as a way to save and retrieve long-term memories.\n",
    "\n",
    "We built a simple chatbot that uses both `short-term (within-thread)` and `long-term (across-thread)` memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "It saved long-term [semantic memory](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/#semantic-memory) (facts about the user) [\"in the hot path\"](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/#writing-memories), as the user is chatting with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Our chatbot saved memories as a string. In practice, we often want memories to have a structure. \n",
    " \n",
    "For example, memories can be a [single, continuously updated schema]((https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/#profile)). \n",
    " \n",
    "In our case, we want this to be a single user profile.\n",
    " \n",
    "We'll extend our chatbot to save semantic memories to a single [user profile](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/#profile). \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also introduce a library, [Trustcall](https://github.com/hinthornw/trustcall), to update this schema with new information. "
