    "## Review\n",
    "\n",
    "We're building up to a multi-agent research assistant that ties together all of the modules from this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "We just covered parallelization, which is one important LangGraph controllability topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we're [going to cover sub-graphs](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/subgraph/#simple-example).\n",
    "\n",
    "## State\n",
    "\n",
    "Sub-graphs allow you to create and manage different states in different parts of your graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is particularly useful for multi-agent systems, with teams of agents that each have their own state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a toy example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* I have a system that accepts logs\n",
    "* It performs two separate sub-tasks by different agents (summarize logs, find failure modes)\n",
    "* I want to perform these two operations in two different sub-graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most critical thing to understand is how the graphs communicate! \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, communication is **done with over-lapping keys**: \n",
    "\n",
    "* The sub-graphs can access `docs` from the parent\n",
    "* The parent can access `summary/failure_report` from the sub-graphs\n",
    "\n",

    "## Input\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define a schema for the logs that will be input to our graph."
