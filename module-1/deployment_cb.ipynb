    "- Provides a task queue for managing asynchronous operations\n",
    "- Offers persistence for maintaining state across interactions\n",

    "`LangGraph Cloud` --\n",
    "- Hosted service for the LangGraph API\n",
    "- Allows deployment of graphs from GitHub repositories\n",
    "- Also provides monitoring and tracing for deployed graphs\n",
    "- Accessible via a unique URL for each deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "`LangGraph Studio` --\n",
    "- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for LangGraph applications\n",
    "- Uses the API as its back-end, allowing real-time testing and exploration of graphs\n",
    "- Can be run locally or with cloud-deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "`LangGraph SDK` --\n",
    "- Python library for programmatically interacting with LangGraph graphs\n",
    "- Provides a consistent interface for working with graphs, whether served locally or in the cloud\n",
